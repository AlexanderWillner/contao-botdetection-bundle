# Installation of Contao BotDetection Bundle

There are two types of installation.

* with the Contao-Manager, for Contao Managed-Editon
* via the command line, for Contao Managed-Editon

Normally this is installed as a dependency, not directly.


## Installation with Contao-Manager

* search for package: `bugbuster/contao-botdetection-bundle`
* install the package


## Installation via command line

Installation in a Composer-based Contao 5.2+ Managed-Edition:

* `composer require "bugbuster/contao-botdetection-bundle"`
